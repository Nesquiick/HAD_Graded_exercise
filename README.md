# HAD_Graded_exercise
* By Lorele√Ø NOIRAUD

Unfortunately, I didn't had the time to implement this part of the project.
I just tried to create a new user an log them in but it doesn't word.
Only the views are implemented, buttons generate errors except the black ones which load others views.

**modules used :**
npm i --s express@4.17.1 @react-navigation/native@5.9.3 @react-navigation/stack"@5.14.3" expo@40.0.0 expo-status-bar@1.0.3 js-base64@3.6.0 react@16.13.1 react-dom@16.13.1 react-native react-native-gesture-handler@1.8.0 react-native-screens@2.15.2 react-native-web@0.13.12
